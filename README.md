To doing the this project i follow the Agile methodology because Agile methodology is a collection of principles that value adaptability and flexibility. Agile aims to provide better responsiveness to changing business needs and therefore focuses on enabling teams to deliver in workable increments.

Itâ€™s always handy to know how to do things best. Here are seven things we both doing when implementing any type of Agile methodology.
I developing an website that could easily make the farmers self-sufficient with the help of it since many of the problems mentioned we got know had just some basic fixes i decided to develop a web page with our computer knowledge which we had.

i created an interface that uses the technological data to the use of a basic customer which is a farmer. i made sure the interface was well designed and simpler to use so that the farmers and working professionals in that field have eased on.

Later this interface had the use and manipulation of data to the use of personel of this area.

i tested the website to few examples, and it worked out well and it was quite helpful.

This recommends the farmer to select a type of crop, its profitability, its best season, the kind of fertilizer and pesticide that works best and is efficient, and lastly which would give some basic feedback and reviews from fellow farmers that have done the methods to take reviews and opinions on the interested topic of the user.

i would like to share the application of the use of technical knowledge and the power of coding to solve real-world problems that could be solved and would benefit a huge mass of people.
